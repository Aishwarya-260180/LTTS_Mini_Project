## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. During cpp-check, online resources helped a lot. 
2. as most of the functions used contains othes function calls in them and required user input so unit test couldnt properly done in most of the functions.
3. while running the multiple files. Make file helped a lot to resolve this.
4. over all stack overflow helped a lot in resolving issues during this project.
