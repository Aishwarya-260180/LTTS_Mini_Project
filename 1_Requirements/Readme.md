# Requirements
## Introduction
 * This project includes various methods of converting  the numbers given by users. This projects helps me to play with number and understand the logic how can numbers be stored and accessed back to perform operations.
 * This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to implement efficient data structures and provides me flexibilty to understand multiple C programming concepts.

## Research
### Converting the numbers Features and Benefits
A number system conversion mini projects main aim is, to provide users with different type possible conversions  in C Programming language. Converting numbers from one form to another form is a task that occurs often in computer programming. 
Often, a human can perform this task intuitively. However, a computer program has to follow a sequence of exact instructions to accomplish this. This sequence of instructions is called an algorithm. 
A number system conversion is a method that can be used to convert numbers from one form to other form. 
There are various methods like converting Binary number to Decimal number, Decimal to binary, Decimal to Octal, Octal to Decimal, Binary to Octal and Octal to Binary.


### Benefits
It is been used by users who wants their numbers to be converted into other format.

### Explanation:
* A number system conversion have few inbuilt features like:
    * Taking input by user
    * Choose among various conversion methods
    * Provide output to user
	* Provide exit provision for user
    



## SWOT ANALYSIS

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
* Small size users who wants convert their numbers from one form to another form available in C Programming Language.

## What:
* Many users are not able to afford high systems and hence still depend on number converting systems. Which takes lot of time to perform operations manually.

## When:
* This can be used whenever any conversion of number is needed.

## Where:
* This problem is expected to surface in all needed situations.

## How:
* This problem may reduce the time taken to convert numbers from one format to another format and helps in better understanding of different formats of number systems available in C Programming Language.

# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements: 
| ID | Description | Category | Status | 
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ---------|
| HR01 | User shall be able to choose among different number systems available  | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR02 | User shall be able to enter the number | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR03 | User shall be able to re-enter numbers | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR04 | User shall be able to exit | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR05 | Data should converted into another format accurately | Scenario | FUTURE |
##  Low level Requirements:
 
| ID | Description | HLR ID | Status (Implemented/Future) |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | ----- |
| LR01 | User shall be able to choose among different number format likes Binary number to Decimal number, Decimal to binary, Decimal to Octal, Octal to Decimal, Binary to Octal and Octal to Binary. | HR01 | TBD-S1 |
| LR02 | User shall be able to enter the numbers as input, here we use the previously entered input i.e, type of conversion as barier to take input from user with that particular format they choosed. Numbers entered should not be in the other format then choosen. | HR02 | TBD-S1 |
| LR03 | If user wish to re-enter the numbers converting system he/she should be provided with main choices again. | HR03 | TBD-S1 |
| LR04 |  User can exit the system if he/she doesnt wishes to continue with any activity of conversion of numbers of the system. User should be provided with the option to exit system with Thank you message. | HR04 | TBD-S1 |
| LR05 | All the operations of converting number system should yeild at accurate results. | HR05 | TBD-S1 |
